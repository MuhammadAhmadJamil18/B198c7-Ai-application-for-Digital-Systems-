Introduction

In the age of artificial intelligence, personalized recommendations have revolutionized content discovery. The Book Recommendation System is an AI-powered application that provides personalized book suggestions based on user preferences, reading history, and interests. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system enhances the reading experience by offering intelligent, data-driven book recommendations.

The system integrates Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering—two core AI algorithms in recommendation systems—to generate precise and relevant book suggestions. Built using Flask, the system ensures an intuitive and interactive user experience. The dataset, containing over 13 million book entries from Kaggle, provides a rich foundation for AI-based predictions.

Features

1. AI-Powered Book Recommendations

Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to generate recommendations.

AI models analyze reading patterns and book metadata to enhance suggestions.

2. Popular Books Section

Displays the top 50 most-read books based on AI-analyzed ratings and reviews.

AI detects trends in user engagement to highlight trending books.

3. Intelligent Personalized Recommendations

Suggests seven books based on AI-driven analysis of user input.

Uses Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering to predict user preferences accurately.

4. Hybrid AI Recommendation Approach

Collaborative Filtering: AI predicts books based on user similarities and past interactions.
